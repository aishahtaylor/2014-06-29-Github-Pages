First \r\nthing you'll need is in account.\r\n\r\nVisit https://github.com/join and sign up, make\r\nsure you choose the **free** options.\r\n\r\n## Configure Your Profile\r\n\r\nPeople will want to know who you are, so make \r\nsure to configure your.\r\n\r\n* Name\r\n* Location\r\n* Photo\r\n\r\n## Generate a New Website Project\r\n\r\nMost of the information about how to use the tool\r\nis laid out on https://pages.github.com/.\r\n\r\nI recommend using the generator to get you started,\r\nwe'll then be editing straight in Github to see the results.\r\n\r\n1. Create a New Repository https://github.com/new\r\n2. Visit the settings\r\n3. Click **Automatice Page Generator**\r\n\r\n## Add your Site to the SUBMISSIONS.md\r\n\r\nWe're going to keep a single index of these sites\r\nso that other students can see what you're building.\r\n\r\n1. Edit The **SUBMISSIONS.md** file\r\n2. Add Your Link (copy the syntax I used for mine)\r\n3. Submit a pull request\r\n\r\nI'll be reviewing all pull requests and either merging\r\nor providing feedback on them.\r\n\r\n## Personalize Your Website\r\n\r\nNow that you've got an address on the internet it's time\r\nto start making it your own. Github Pages uses [Jekyll] to\r\nmanage its content. Jekyll is a simple and powerful tool\r\nfor managing html information. \r\n\r\nSome goals to try an achieve\r\n\r\n1. Update your homepage with your information\r\n2. Create a blog post outlining what you did today\r\n3. Include links to your Twitter, Instagram etc.\r\n4. Include links to your friends github pages\r\n\r\n[Jekyll]: http://jekyllrb.com/\r\n\r\n## Qeustions, Problems, Comments?\r\n\r\nUp until now you have been fairly dependent on having a trainer\r\naround to answers your questions. For this meetup I'd like all\r\ndiscussion to take place online, through Github. As you progress\r\nin your career you will be using the internet (and most likely\r\nGithub) increasingly more to find libraries and join in the \r\ndevelopment of open source software.\r\n\r\nIf you have any problems today you're going to be expected to use\r\nthe internet to find the solution. In the event that you have\r\n\"Googled\" your issue and still need an answer you can add your\r\nvoice to an existing one or open a new [Issue]. If you see an issue\r\nyou know the answer to, feel free to offer help, I'll notice that sort\r\nof thing.\r\n\r\nOne last thing: Try to avoid asking duplicate questions, if I see a \r\nduplicate I'm just going to close it and direct the poster\r\nto the initial request.\r\n\r\n[Issue]: https://github.com/codenoworg-nyc-meetups/2014-06-29-Github-Pages/issues\r\n\r\n## Think you can fix something? Do it\r\n\r\nYou can use Pull Request to submit proposals for changes to this repository.\r\n\r\nTo do so, open the file in Github, edit it, and commit your changes. You'll\r\nthen be presented with an option to open a pull request.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
